# commute_stitcher

This application combines multiple forms of transport to determine the fastest way to commute from work to school. Currently, it combines driving, transit, and walking.

Motivation:
When commuting to school, I wanted to find the best way of driving and using the bus in order to get to school. I found that google maps and other popular directions applications did not allow the user to combine multiple forms of transport, so I would have to do the math on my own each time to determine what bus stop to drive to and what bus to take inorder to get to my destionation. I figured people like myself who commute to school or work would find it useful to have access to a tool which does this calculation for them. 

Methods:
Python, Flask, Html, CSS, JavaScript, Google Compute Engine, Google Maps Python Api, Google Maps Web JavaScript Api, Git
